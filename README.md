## Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900): Identity, Deployment, and Management
- By Mike Boorman

- INTRODUCTION:
  - Azure AD. Now Microsoft Entra ID. 
  - Azure resources, including Azure Resource Manager.
  - Permissions and roles.
  - Why are we here? The exam.

- AZURE IDENTITY, AUTHENTICATION, AND AUTHORIZATION:
  - The three:
    - Identity: Who, or what, a person or object claims to be.
      - Passport. DL. Azure Active Directory object. Software license.
      - "The unique identifier for any digital object."
    - Authentication: The process of validating an identity. The proof.
      - House key. SSH key. SSL certificate. Email account password.
      - "Proves the identity."
    - Authorization: The process of validating what an identity *can* do.
      - An event ticket. Key code. Application secret. SAS token. (Shared access signature.)
      - "Scopes the identity."
  - Azure Active Directory: 
    - Service for managing identity, authentication, and authorization.
    - Applied to Azure and third-party services, etc.  Rebranded Microsoft Entra ID.
    - Modern architecture, protocols, and methods. Cloud-native design.
    - Microsoft Entra: 
      - Azure Active Directory: Part of the new (broader) Microsoft Entra (product) family.
      - Permissions Management:
      - Verified ID:
    - AD: Legacy office solution. Lagacy Web. Legacy Authentication.
      - Requirements: Automatic/mandatory. Minimum one user.
    - Tenant: Organization. Dedicated Azure AD. Separate. No cross-over or connection.
      - A user can be a member or guest of up to 500 tenants.
      - "A tenant is a dedicated instance of Azure AD/Entra ID."
      - "It represents your organization in Azure."
    - Subscription. Billing entity. Cost separation. Payment.
  - Zero trust model: Classic trusted versus untrusted model.
    - Trusted perimeter. Corporate devices.
      - Must be on the corporate network to access resources.
        - VPN is extension of trusted perimeter. Mobile devices are even more challenging.
        - Broad scope of access.
      - Zero trust. All users are assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise.
        - Trusted by identity. Regardless of location. 
        - Least privilege access. Simplified, central management.
        - Zero trust = trusted identities, not location.
          - Pushed trust to the individual level.
  - Multi-factor Authentication:
    - Layered security
    - MFA Model: 
      - First factor: Something you know. Second factor: Something you have.
      - Included: something you are.
  - Conditional access:
    - Authentication that protections beyond username/password.
      - If/then: if user meets conditions, then...
      - Assign signals (conditions):
        - Users/groups.
        - Application to grant/deny access.
        - Location (IP.)
        - Approved devices.
    - Scenarios:
      - Enforce MFA for all administrators and users.
      - Block legacy authentication.
      - Grant access only to specific locations.
      - Require organization-managed devices for application sign-in.
  - Password-less authentication:
    - Security versus convenience. MFA is more secure, but less convenient.


- MANAGEMENT AND DEPLOYMENT TOOLS:

- CONCLUSION:
